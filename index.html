      I am probably the best person that i know in the world (this is written by my best friend). I'm kind, funny, got a smokin hot body and
      am genuine to the core. I care more about others than I do about myself... sometimes to my detriment but that's what makes me happy. I always
      strive to be the best and face whatever advercities are in my way. I'm Anne Sophie "fucking" Kristiansen and you better not forget it.
      - <strong>Reiterate this was written by my best friend, not me.</strong>

    <h2>Would you want to go on a date with asophiek?</h2>
    <p>Gentlemen (or ladies) lets face it, you gotta prove your bombass enough to be with the human manifestation of brunch
      (because she's the best snack on the table)
    leave your contact details <a href="contact-details.html">here</a> and her secretary will get back to you if you're chosen to be in the application process. </p>
